# Home_Sales
Submission for Module 22 for Data Analysis bootcamp

In this challenge, you'll use your knowledge of SparkSQL to determine key metrics about home sales data. Then you'll use Spark to create temporary views, partition the data, cache and uncache a temporary table, and verify that the table has been uncached.





Note: The Jupyter lab notebook file is from Google Colab.  I was unable to get this functioning locally (environmental issue).
